# Fatigue-Adaptive_E-Bike_Control

This is a final project for ME6409: Biomechatronics of Wearable Robotics. The project is designed for MATLAB 2020a for use with Simulink. The primary models for use are Models/FatigueAdaptive.slx and Models/TorqueMultiplier.slx. The Models/ReferenceModels/ directory contains working and reference models in building our models. The plotting and data anslysi are done with Data_Collection.mlx and Plotting.mlx.
